# deep_learning

This repository has the materials and scripts to support the course of introduction to Deep Learning at Universidad Nacional de Colombia

## General Objective 

To give the participant knowledge about deep neural networks and their architecture to solve multidimensional problems related to tabular data, text, and imagery. This gives the basis about Keras, Tensorflow and FastAI deep learning frameworks, and presents relevant papers related to problems like image classification, image detection, semantic segmentation, generative models and sequence to sequence neural machine translation.

### Specific Objetives

To present the Background, types of DNN and their applications.
To use transfer learning and data labeling.
To develop DNN algorithms to solve classification, detection and image segmentation problems.
To introduce a couple of libraries and frameworks to work with DNNs.
To learn how to train and evaluate model performance, metrics and overfitting.
